<h2>Introducci√≥n <span class="math inline">\(2^k\)</span></h2>
<p>La familia de dise√±os completos <span
class="math inline">\(2^k\)</span> son aquellos que son de <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> factores con dos niveles, estos dise√±os
son muy √∫tiles cuando se tienen <span class="math inline">\(2 \leq k
\leq 5\)</span> factores, lo que significa que significa evaluar entre 4
y 32 tratamientos, esta cantidad es manejable a nivel experimental y de
mucho impacto en la industria y en la investigaci√≥n. En los dise√±os
factoriales evaluamos los efectos de los efectos fijos con su
interacci√≥n, en este caso evaluaremos los dise√±os con dos niveles y
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> tratamientos, el m√°s simple es el
dise√±o <span class="math inline">\(2^2\)</span>.</p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="factorial-22" class="section level2">
<h2>Factorial <span class="math inline">\(2^2\)</span></h2>
<p>Con este dise√±o se estudia el efecto de dos factores con dos niveles
en cada uno, cada r√©plica de este dise√±o consiste un arreglo <span
class="math inline">\(2 \times 2=4\)</span> combinaciones o
tratamientos. Las notaciones de los niveles de los factores pueden ser a
partir de su cantidad o denotando los niveles mayor o menor de la
siguiente forma: <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> para el nivel
mayor y <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> para el nivel menor,
esta notaci√≥n es √∫til a la hora de hacer los c√°lculos para ajustar por
m√≠nimos cuadrados un modelo de regresi√≥n a los datos; es la notaci√≥n que
usa el software <code>Minitab</code>, y tambi√©n la recibe
<code>R</code>.</p>
<p>La notaci√≥n de signos <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(‚Äì\)</span> es muy pr√°ctica para escribir las
matrices de dise√±o; esta notaci√≥n, combinada con la de Yates permite
representar y calcular f√°cilmente los efectos de inter√©s. La notaci√≥n
con letras <span class="math inline">\(A^+\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(A^‚Äì\)</span> se utiliza para escribir, al final
del an√°lisis del experimento, el mejor punto o tratamiento ganador que
se ha encontrado.</p>
<p>La notaci√≥n de Yates <span class="math inline">\([(1), a, b,
ab]\)</span> tiene un significado diferente a las dem√°s: con ella se
representa el total o la suma de las observaciones en cada tratamiento,
m√°s que al tratamiento mismo. Hay que observar que la l√≥gica de la
notaci√≥n de Yates es la siguiente: si una letra min√∫scula est√° presente,
entonces el factor correspondiente se encuentra en su nivel alto; si
est√° ausente, el factor est√° en su nivel bajo; por ejemplo, <span
class="math inline">\(ab\)</span> se refiere al tratamiento en el que
los factores <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> y <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> est√°n en su nivel alto.</p>

<p>El dise√±o factorial <span class="math inline">\(2^2\)</span> se
representa de manera geom√©trica por los v√©rtices de un cuadrado. Cada
v√©rtice representa un punto de dise√±o o tratamiento. El √°rea limitada
por este cuadrado se conoce como <strong>regi√≥n experimental</strong> y,
en principio, las conclusiones que se obtengan del experimento s√≥lo
tienen validez sobre esta regi√≥n.</p>

<h3>C√°lculo de los efectos</h3>
<p>En este dise√±o hay tres efectos de inter√©s: los dos efectos
principales (A y B) y el efecto de interacci√≥n (AB). Con el uso de la
notaci√≥n de Yates podemos ver que si cada tratamiento se corre <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> veces, entonces la media de <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> en el nivel alto de <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> es <span class="math inline">\((a +
ab)/2n\)</span> y en el nivel bajo es <span class="math inline">\((b +
(1))/2n\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Efecto
A}=\frac{1}{2n}[a+ab-b-(1)]=\frac{[a+ab]}{2n}-\frac{[b+(1)]}{2n}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Efecto
B}=\frac{1}{2n}[b+ab-a-(1)]=\frac{[b+ab]}{2n}-\frac{[a+(1)]}{2n}\]</span></p>
<p>En sentido geom√©trico, el efecto <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> equivale a promediar los datos del
<strong>lado derecho</strong> del cuadrado de la figura anterior y
<strong>restarles</strong> el promedio de los datos del <strong>lado
izquierdo</strong>; mientras que para el efecto <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> se promedian los datos del <strong>lado
de arriba</strong> y se le <strong>resta</strong> la media de los datos
del <strong>lado de abajo</strong>.</p>
<p>El efecto de interacci√≥n entre los factores <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> y <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> est√° dado por la diferencia entre el
efecto de <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> en el nivel alto de
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> y el efecto de <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> en el nivel bajo de <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, esto es,</p>
<span class="math display">\[\text{Efecto
AB}=\frac{1}{2n}[ab+(1)-a-b]=\frac{[ab-b]}{2n}-\frac{[a-(1)]}{2n}\]</span>

<div id="anova" class="section level3">
<h3>ANOVA</h3>
<p>Aunque los efectos calculados con los datos muestren diferencias,
esto no implica que sean <em>estad√≠sticamente diferentes</em> de cero.
Para afirmar que los efectos son significativos y que la diferencia
entre ellos tambi√©n lo sea, se requiere ajustar el modelo mediante la
ANOVA.</p>
<p>Para construir el ANOVA necesitamos descomponer las suma de cuadrados
de los factores, al tratarse de un dise√±o <span
class="math inline">\(2^k\)</span> es necesario establecer los
contrastes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Contraste }A=[a+ab-b-(1)]\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\text{Contraste }B=[b+ab-a-(1)]\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\text{Contraste
}AB=[ab+(1)-a-b]\]</span></p>
<p>Son contrastes por el hecho de que son combinaciones lineales donde
los coeficientes suman cero <span class="math inline">\((1 + 1 ‚Äì 1 ‚Äì 1 =
0)\)</span>. Una vez obtenido el contraste, el efecto correspondiente se
obtiene dividi√©ndolo entre la constante que lo convierta en una
diferencia de medias; este n√∫mero es la mitad de las observaciones
hechas en el experimento. Por ejemplo, en el factoria1 <span
class="math inline">\(2^k\)</span> con <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> r√©plicas los contrastes se dividen por
<span class="math inline">\(n2^{(k ‚Äì l)}\)</span> para estimar los
efectos; en particular para el dise√±o <span
class="math inline">\(2^2\)</span> con <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> r√©plicas se divide por <span
class="math inline">\(n2^{(2 ‚Äì 1)} = 2n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Una manera pr√°ctica de establecer los contrastes de cualquier efecto,
sea principal o de interacci√≥n en el dise√±o factorial <span
class="math inline">\(2^k\)</span> es mediante el auxilio de una tabla
de signos.</p>

<p>Una vez obtenidos los contrastes se procede a estimar los efectos,
dividiendo √©stos por la constante que los convierte en diferencias de
medias. Se tienen entonces las siguientes hip√≥tesis:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_0: \text{Efecto }A = 0 \quad vs \quad
H_a: \text{Efecto }A \neq 0\\
H_0: \text{Efecto }B = 0 \quad vs \quad H_a: \text{Efecto }B \neq 0\\
H_0: \text{Efecto }AB = 0 \quad vs \quad H_a: \text{Efecto }AB \neq
0\]</span></p>
<p>Las sumas de cuadrados se calcula dividiendo los contrastes por la
constante, en particular, el dise√±o factorial <span
class="math inline">\(2^2\)</span> que est√° constante es <span
class="math inline">\(2n\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[SS_A=\frac{[a+ab-b-(1)]}{n2^2}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[SS_B=\frac{[b+ab-a-(1)]}{n2^2}\]</span>
<span
class="math display">\[SS_{AB}=\frac{[ab+(1)-a-b]}{n2^2}\]</span></p>
<p>donde cada una de ellas tiene <strong>s√≥lo un grado de
libertad</strong>, debido a que cada factor tiene √∫nicamente <strong>dos
niveles</strong>. La suma de cuadrados totales se calcula:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[SS_T=\sum_{i=1}^2\sum_{j=1}^2\sum_{l=1}^2
Y_{ijl}^2-\frac{Y_{...}^2}{n2^2}\]</span></p>
<p>Y la suma de cuadrados del error se calcula como:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[SS_E=SS_T-SS_A-SS_B-SS_{AB}\]</span></p>

<p>Una vez se construye la tabla de ANOVA se verifican los supuestos del
modelos a trav√©s de los residuales o errores aleatorios, similar a los

<h2>Introducci√≥n <span class="math inline">\(3^k\)</span></h2>
<p>En estos dise√±os se consideran <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
factores con tres niveles cada uno y tiene <span
class="math inline">\(3^k\)</span> tratamientos. La primera desventaja
de los dise√±os <span class="math inline">\(3^k\)</span> es que al
aplicarse requieren mayor cantidad de pruebas que el dise√±o <span
class="math inline">\(2^k\)</span>. Sin embargo, cuando se tienen pocos
factores, tres como m√°ximo, o en el peor de los casos cuatro, hay
algunas situaciones pr√°cticas en las que el dise√±o <span
class="math inline">\(3^k\)</span> es una buena alternativa:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Se tienen factores de tipo continuo e interesa estudiar efectos
cuadr√°ticos como <span class="math inline">\(A^2, B^2,\dots, A^2B, B^2A,
A^2B^2,\dots\)</span> (efectos de curvatura). Esto se hace cuando se
cree que la variable de respuesta no es lineal, ni aproximadamente
lineal en el rango de variaci√≥n de los factores estudiados.</p></li>
<li><p>Los factores son categ√≥ricos o discretos y de manera natural
tienen tres niveles cada uno. Esto ocurre en factores como tipo de
material, diferentes medios de cultivos, factor m√°quina, etc., los
cuales pueden tener naturalmente tres niveles.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="DE_fact23_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="810" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>En esta figura se observa que para estudiar un efecto lineal, o
aproximadamente lineal, basta con probar el factor X en dos niveles,
mientras que para estudiar un efecto cuadr√°tico son necesarios al menos
tres niveles del factor X. El problema es que de antemano no se sabe
c√≥mo ser√° el efecto del factor y a veces se corre el riesgo de utilizar
dos niveles, cuando en realidad se requer√≠an de al menos tres. El dise√±o
factorial <span class="math inline">\(3^k\)</span> es una de las
alternativas experimentales que permite estudiar efectos de curvatura,
adem√°s de efectos lineales y de interacci√≥n.</p>

<p>El ANOVA considera los efectos <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
y <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> de manera global, es decir,
sin especificar si influyen de manera <strong>lineal</strong>,
<strong>cuadr√°tica</strong> o de <strong>ambas formas</strong>. Las
sumas de cuadrados de cada efecto se pueden descomponer en sumas de
cuadrados con un grado de libertad. Por ejemplo, la suma de cuadra dos
del efecto <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> con 2 grados de
libertad se puede desglosar en los componentes <span
class="math inline">\(A_L\)</span> y <span
class="math inline">\(A^2\)</span> (efecto lineal y cuadr√°tico) cada uno
con un grado de libertad.</p>
<p>El sub√≠ndice <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> indica que es la
parte lineal del efecto global <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, y
el exponente denota la parte cuadr√°tica. Asimismo, la suma de cuadrados
de <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> se puede partir en cuatro
componentes con un grado de libertad: <span
class="math inline">\(A_LB_L\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(A_LB^2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(A^2B_L\)</span> y <span
class="math inline">\(A^2B_L\)</span>. As√≠, para tener informaci√≥n m√°s
detallada de c√≥mo es que afectan los factores, es necesario separar los
ocho componentes con un grado de libertad y construir un ANOVA que
muestre la significancia de cada uno de ellos.</p>

<h2>Ejemplo</h2>
<p>En un proceso de fabricaci√≥n de cajas se utiliza pegamento; con la
idea de mejorar el desempe√±o de las cajas se realiza un experimento para
estudiar la fuerza de adhesi√≥n del pegamento en diferentes condiciones
de humedad y temperatura. La variable de respuesta es la fuerza
necesaria en libras (lb) para despegar la caja. Los datos obtenidos en
cada una de las nueve combinaciones de un dise√±o factorial <span
class="math inline">\(3^2\)</span> con <span class="math inline">\(n =
2\)</span> r√©plicas, se muestran a continuaci√≥n:</p>

<p>Entonces el modelo resultante muestra que el efecto curvatura en la
temperatura es significativo, as√≠ el modelo puede escribirse como:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat
Y=2.65+(1.14167)T+(-0.50833)H+(-0.275)T^2+(-0.225)T*H\]</span></p>
<p>Con la ecuaci√≥n determinada es posible establecer los valores
